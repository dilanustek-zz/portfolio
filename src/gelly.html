                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Gelly</b> is a flexible and transparent mutual capacitance sensor that currently has proximity and
                    touch sensing capabilities.
                    My project aims to explore the application space of this sensor.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    My research shows that proximity sensors are widely explored in phones but in-air gestures would
                    be highly beneficial in solving the real-estate problems that small screened wearables such as the
                    smartwatch is currently experiencing.
                    </p><p>
                    Additionally, mid-air interactions could solve problems in situations where people cannot touch a
                screen for sterility, or cleanliness reasons.
                </p>

                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    My project supervisor is Prof. Karon Maclean. I started the Gelly project in May 2016 and now lead
                    the project which also has two undergrads. I am involved in the ideation, design, development, and research
                    aspects of the Gelly project. I collaborate with Prof. John Madden's lab in the Electrical Engineering department
                    whose team works on the engineering development of the Gelly sensor.

                <h3> Step 1: Brainstorming </h3>

                <p>
                    The first step of the project was naturally brainstorming for applications where proximity could be beneficial.
                    My ideation process was coming up with general fields that might be useful to explore, and then thinking
                    deeper on how proximity could be applied to solve existent problems.
                    I then created a brainstorm map to categorize each field and find any relevance between them.
                    Here is a the map I created:
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    I then made a bunch of quick sketches to explore some of these ideas further:
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used <i>Sketch</i> to design laser-cut wrist-bands for the Gelly sensor to sit on.

                <h3> Step 2: Setting Focus </h3>

                <p>
                    To set focus, I did background research to figure out what is an innovative field that Gelly
                    could be used in that could solve people's problems in their daily life. I set focus on
                    mid-air interactions for wearables(to take advantage of the flexibility property of the technology)
                    and to solve problems that people face when they cannot touch the screen of their devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Me and my undergraduate student wrote a prior art review from our background research. This
                    documentation involved prior academic research, other technologies out there, and patent search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wrote a Java program to visualize data received from the sensor and started implementing Gelly's software.
                </p>

                <h3> Step 3: Designing Interactions </h3>

                <p>
                    The next step was designing the interactions. First, I sketched some versions of birds, chicks, and
                    chicks from the back perspective.
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <figure >
                        <img src="img/portfolio/gelly/chicDrawings.jpg"  width="100%"/>
                        <figcaption>Having fun with sketching</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>

                    Then I used <i>Sketch App</i>
                    and animated the chicks using <i>Principle for Mac</i>.
                    Because of an ongoing patent application, I cannot share the ideas and the animations yet. However,
                    to give an idea of what the animations would be like here is an example from a smartwatch GUI interaction
                    using proximity:
                </p>

                        <figcaption>Disclaimer: This is not one of the ideas I am pursuing in my project. </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    To illustrate what kind of capabilities proximity would introduce, I also designed the following animation
                    of a game called Angry Chicks using <i>Sketch</i> and <i>Principle</i> design tools.
                </p>

                    </figure>

            <div class="project-step">
                <h3> Step 4: Client Feedback </h3>

                <p>
                    An important step in the proess was getting client feedback. I presented our findings, and
                    animations to them and received valuable feedback.

                <h3> Step 5: Design User Study </h3>

                <p>
                   With my student, we designed a user study that would test the usability (including performance time), user experience in terms
                    of pleasantness and fluidity of the experience, and whether they feel a connectedness illusion even though
                    they were not in contact with anything. We've iterated over this study design multiple times and as we

            <div class="project-step">
                <h3> Step 6: Implement Prototype </h3>

                <p>
                    This is the step I am currently on. In order to run my user study, I first need to implement a working
                    prototype of my interactions with sample applications on a smartwatch and tablet using a Leap Motion Controller.
                </p>

            <div class="project-step">
                <h3> Step 7: Run Study </h3>

                <p>
                    After I have a working prototype I will run my user study to get information on what users find good
                    and bad about my interaction techniques.
                </p>

                <h3> Step 8: Iterate </h3>

                <p>
                    After getting data from the user study, I can then iterate and create a better interaction that is
                    more usable and enjoyable for users.
