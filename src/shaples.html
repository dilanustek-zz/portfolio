            <p>What products could we design with a display that would allow us to feel bumps and corrugations? </p>

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p> A typical design process sparks with a problem in a person or group of people's lives. In this project,
                    we started with a technical innovation and aimed to be the first ones to get a chance to brainstorm
                    about problems that it could solve.
                    </p><p>

                    <b>Polymer shape display</b> is a new technology will enable people to feel bumps and corrugations.
                    Since this technology was not yet available, this project simulated this new type of display
                    to explore possible applications. As the technology makes barely perceivable corrugations, we
                    examined the ways in which information can be conveyed in this context.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    We took a <b>bottom-up approach</b> and started by brainstorming variables in touch. Using laser engraving to simulate
                    the upcoming technology, we prototyped a few
                    applications that show that building a high fidelity prototype of a product with a polymer shape
                    changing display is feasible and that it will generate valuable products.
                </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>

            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 1: Brainstorming  </h3>

                <p>
                Without limiting ourselves, we had a brainstorming session on what this technology could be used for. Here are
                    some of the ideas we liked: <br>

                    1- Enhanced GUI (buttons and windows that you can feel, move around, and can bump into each other) <br>
                    2- Guitar playing app (can feel the string and once plucked, the string moves around) <br>
                    3- Electronic shopping (feeling different textures) <br>
                    4- Image editing (you can feel the objects, lines etc and can pull push them to edit image with finger)<br>
                    5- Braille reading display<br>
                    6- Wearable smart watch that generates bumps and corrugations around the band.<br>
                </p>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 2: Early Stage Rapid Prototyping  </h3>

                <p> In this early stage, we needed to do rapid prototypes that allow us to test one part of any idea. Depending
                    on what we needed to learn from the prototype, the fidelity level was very different in each one.
                </p><p>
                   For example; we wanted to see if users
                    could feel a passive touch on their wrist if we were to take that route, or what it would
                    take to enable them to feel small corrugations.
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/shaples1.jpg"  width="40%" />
                </div>

                <p>Another example is a prototype of a corrugation wave using sticks, balloons, and fabric:</p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/shaples2.jpg"  width="20%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/shaples3.jpg"  width="20%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/shaples4.jpg"  width="20%"/>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/shaples5.jpg"  width="20%" />
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 3: Exploration of Corrugation Techniques in the Context of Applications</h3>

                <p>
                   In order to prototype corrugations, we first needed to explore different corrugation techniques to
                    discover the best way to prototype the one closest to our technology's capabilities.
                    We made a haptic keypad on the back of the phone that users could use to enter numbers while
                    talking on the phone to a virtual phone assistant. We then discovered different corrugations
                    seen in the image below.
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/cor1.jpg" width="20%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/cor2.jpg" width="20%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/cor3.jpg" width="50%" />
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 4: Product Sketches</h3>

                <p>Through <b>scenario-type brainstorming</b> we came up with the following ideas and sketches:</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Haptic Keypad</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This application is a haptic keypad on the back of the phone. We used heat shrinks and thin wires to
                    make small corrugation blocks, that we called shaples (comes from the word taxels).
                    We made them in different blocks so that we could test whether different positions of corrugations made
                    any effect on its perception.
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/sketch1.jpg" width="43%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/sketch2.jpg" width="15%" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b>Call Accept/Reject</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This application is a behind-the-device accept/reject interaction that appears if a second call arrives
                    while the user is on a call so that they can continue talking with a quick swipe of the finger on the
                    back of the phone. Again, we prototyped two different sizes of corrugations and put them to a <b>user test</b>.
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/sketch3.jpg" width="15%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/sketch4.jpg" width="23%" />
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 5: User Study</h3>

                <p>
                    We conducted a small informal study on the haptic keypad and call accept/reject prototypes. <br><br>

                    Users mostly preferred swiping up to reject a call and swiping down to accept a call. They were
                    very fast at finding the right numbers on the keypad, but felt that the keys were placed in an
                    awkward way for the index finger to reach. <br><br>

                    We realized that because the users held the phones diagonally on their ears and not upright, we
                    could improve our design by arranging the keys diagonally. Additionally, one of the participants
                    suggested a very interesting redesign idea which would involve rearranging the keys in an
                    amphitheater-like manner since the range that the index finger can reach is larger as it goes up on the phone.
                </p>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 6: Revised Direction Due to Engineering Limitations</h3>

                <p>
                    The engineers working on the technology informed us that the corrugations could only be made
                    to be the size of a human hair. So I took a couple of my hairs and used them to prototype.
                    The resulting corrugations were perceivable only when the finger is moved perpendicularly to the hairs multiple times.
                </p>

                <p> We then came up with a better way to make these small scaled corrugations and to make them fast: laser engraving and cutting!</p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/hair.jpg" width="57%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/samples.jpg" width="30%" />
                </div>

                <p>The scale change of the corrugations unfortunately meant that our prototypes so far could not be feasible as the corrugations
                would not be perceivable. After another iteration of brainstorming, we decided these mini corrugations could be
                useful to convey state to a user who is in contact with a device using their finger. </p>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 7: User Study to Convey Information using Mini Corrugations</h3>

                <p>
                    In order to design a product that can convey information with mini corrugations, we needed to figure
                    out how this would be possible. From our user study we found that: <br><br>

                    1- 3 easily distinguishable states can be conveyed for urgent notifications. <br>
                    2- A 4th state (on/off half-checkerboard) can be added if need be but both of the checkerboard states will lose their urgency.<br>
                    3- 5 is the likely limit of states of information for this scale (more testing needed to conclude)
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/info.jpg" width="60%" />
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="project-step">
                <h3>Step 8: Product Sketches and Prototypes</h3>

                <p>
                    Finally, we designed the following applications that would be feasible to build with the upcoming shaple technology:
                </p>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <p>
                    1- <b>A credit card</b> that convey users information on their usage so that they can stay in their monthly budget that was pre-set. <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/prot1.jpg" width="60%" />
                </div>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <p>
                    2- <b>A trackpad</b> that can give information about battery left so users can no longer ignore the warning to plug their charger. <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/prot3.jpg" width="60%" />
                </div>

                <div class="project-photos">
                    <p>
                    3- <b>A shaple box</b> that will give information on the weight of the box before a user picks it up. <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/prot4.jpg" width="50%" />
                    <img src="img/portfolio/shaples/prot2.jpg" width="45%" />

                <h2 style="margin-top:0px;"> Lessons Learned </h2>
                <p>
                    1- Grab and try! Anything can change shape and form. Look around you and think “What else can I heat/bend/break/fix?” <br>
                    2- Make things modular. This way, it requires less effort if other use cases or features come up, and if any part needs
                    to change you can simply change a small part without making a whole new prototype.<br>
                    3-Iterate often and go back to the client to get as much detail as possible. It was good that we got
                    feedback quickly after building our low-fidelity prototypes.<br>
